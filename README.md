# Operating Systems (CS330A) Assginments

This repository contains my solutions to the three assignments as part of the course **CS330A - Operating Systems**, offered at IIT Kanpur for the 2023-24 odd semester by Professor Debadatta Mishra.

The first three assignments consist of development on an OS made using the **gem5** architectural simulator. This OS will be referred to as **gemOS**. 

**Assignment 1** - OS preliminaries, including implementations of gemOS library functions memalloc() and memfree().
**Assignment 2** - Implemented read/write functionalities for trace buffers, and implemented system call and function tracing.
**Assignment 3** - Implemented functions for memory virtualization via functions like mmap(), munmap() and mprotect(). Also created paging functionalities by page table manipulation and implemented functions to implement Copy-on-Write (CoW) faults.
